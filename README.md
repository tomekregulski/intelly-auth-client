# Intelly - General Overview and Current State

Intelly is a platform being built to help small-to-medium-sized food and beverage brands manage various aspects of their business. The project is divided into separate repos to allow independent development. Below, you can find a list of the specific front and back ends that make up this project, links to their individual repos, as well as whether or not they have been deployed for public demo.

The public demos should be accessed thought this link: https://gallant-wing-415919.netlify.app/
This will bring you to a login page, which you can enter with the following credentials:

email: guest@intelly.test
password: guest

Once logged in, you will be brough to a dashboard that allows you to navigate the project in its current form. The guest account will have access to all services currently deployed for public demo, with only certain subservices being excluded to prevent any possible interference with sensitive data.

# This Specific Repo - Overview

As mentioned above, Intelly is split into several independent repos in order to facilitate different timelines for development, and thus make it possible to demonstrate those services that have reached an appropriate stage of devlopment.

The repo you are currently visiting is the front end for the Authentication App. Its purpose is to act as independent authentication and autherization across the entire project.

Its current functionality issues a JWT upon successful login that includes the user's password and email in its signature. When the user navigates across different projects, this JWT is passed as a query and used to re-establish access.

# Additional Goals for Development

While the current stage of this app succeeds in allowing a user to persist logged in status and appropriate level of access while navigating accross different apps in the Intelly project, it does not achieve the desired level of security. We are exploring alternative approaches that allows us to avoid exposing the JWT at any point of the process.

# Installation and Contribution

If you wish to test this project locally, you may clone the repo to a directory on your machine. Navigate to the new directory using your terminal, and install all necessary dependencies by running the command 'npm i'.

The app itself should be set up to connect to the deployed server, so at that point, you should be able to start it up by running the command 'npm start' and navigating to localhost:3000 in your browser.

At this time, I am not inviting individual contribution, unless there has been a specific conversation around it. If you come across something in the code that you wish to share, by all means message me and we can speak about it.
